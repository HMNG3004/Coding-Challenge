# **Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level**

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with **unique values**.

In one operation, you can choose any two nodes at the same level and swap their values.

_Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each level sorted in a **strictly increasing order**._

The **level** of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.
