# **Maximum Average Pass Ratio**

There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]`. You know beforehand that in the **i<sup>th</sup>**
class, there are **total<sub>i</sub>** total students, but only **pass<sub>i</sub>** number of students will pass the exam.

You are also given an integer `extraStudents`. There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are **guaranteed** to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that **maximizes** the **average** pass ratio across **all** the classes.

The **pass ratio** of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The **average pass ratio** is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.

_Return the **maximum** possible average pass ratio after assigning the `extraStudents` students. Answers within **10<sup>-5</sup>** of the actual answer will be accepted._
