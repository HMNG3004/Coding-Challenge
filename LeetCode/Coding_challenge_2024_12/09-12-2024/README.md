# **Special Array II**

An array is considered **special** if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.

You are given an array of integer `nums` and a 2D integer matrix `queries`, where for `queries[i] = [fromi, toi]` your task is to check that
subarray `nums[fromi..toi]` is **special** or not.

Return an array of booleans `answer` such that `answer[i]` is `true` if `nums[fromi..toi]` is special.
