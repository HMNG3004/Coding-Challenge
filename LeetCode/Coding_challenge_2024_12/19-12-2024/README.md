# **Max Chunks To Make Sorted**

You are given an integer array `arr` of length `n` that represents a permutation of the integers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

We split `arr` into some number of **chunks** (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

_Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array._
