# **Count Vowel Strings in Ranges**

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` and a 2D array of integers `queries`.

Each query **queries[i] = [l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]** asks us to find the number of strings present in the range l<sub>i</sub> to r<sub>i</sub> (both **inclusive**) of `words` that start and end with a vowel.

_Return an array `ans` of size `queries.length`, where `ans[i]` is the answer to the i<sup>th</sup> query._

**Note** that the vowel letters are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.
