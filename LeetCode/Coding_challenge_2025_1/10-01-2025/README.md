# **Word Subsets**

You are given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`.

A string `b` is a **subset** of string `a` if every letter in `b` occurs in `a` including multiplicity.

For example, `"wrr"` is a subset of `"warrior"` but is not a subset of `"world"`.
A string `a` from `words1` is **universal** if for every string `b` in `words2`, `b` is a subset of `a`.

Return an array of all the **universal** strings in `words1`. You may return the answer in **any order**.
