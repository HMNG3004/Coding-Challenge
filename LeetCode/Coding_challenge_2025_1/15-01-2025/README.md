# **Minimize XOR**

Given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`, find the positive integer `x` such that:

- `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and
- The value `x XOR num1` is minimal.

Note that `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return _the integer `x`_. The test cases are generated such that `x` is uniquely determined.

The number of *set bits* of an integer is the number of `1`'s in its binary representation.
