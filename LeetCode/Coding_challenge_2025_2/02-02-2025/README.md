# **Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated**

Given an array `nums`, return `true` _if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero)_. Otherwise, return `false`.

There may be **duplicates** in the original array.

**Note**: An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of the same length such that `A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length]`, where `%` is the modulo operation.
