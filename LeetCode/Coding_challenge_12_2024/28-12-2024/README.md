# **Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays**

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find three non-overlapping subarrays of length `k` with maximum sum and return them.

Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (**0-indexed**). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.
