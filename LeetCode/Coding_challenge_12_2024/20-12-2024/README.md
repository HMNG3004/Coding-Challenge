# **Max Chunks To Make Sorted**

Given the `root` of a **perfect** binary tree, reverse the node values at each odd level of the tree.

- For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are `[2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18]`, then it should become `[18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2]`.

_Return the root of the reversed tree._

A binary tree is **perfect** if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.

The **level** of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.
