# **Count Ways To Build Good Strings**

Given the integers `zero`, `one`, `low`, and `high`, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

- Append the character `'0'` `zero` times.
- Append the character `'1'` `one` times.

This can be performed any number of times.

A **good** string is a string constructed by the above process having a **length** between `low` and `high` (**inclusive**).

_Return the number of **different** good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties._ Since the answer can be large, return it **modulo** **10<sup>9</sup> + 7**.
