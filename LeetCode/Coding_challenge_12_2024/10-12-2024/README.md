# **Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I**

You are given a string `s` that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called **special** if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string `"abc"` is not special, whereas the strings `"ddd"`, `"zz"`, and `"f"` are special.

_Return the length of the **longest special substring** of `s` which occurs **at least thrice**, or `-1` if no special substring occurs at least thrice._

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.
