# **Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations I**

You are given a string `s` and an integer `repeatLimit`. Construct a new string `repeatLimitedString` using the characters of `s` such that no letter appears **more than** `repeatLimit` times `in a row`. You do not have to use all characters from `s`.

_Return the *lexicographically largest*_ `repeatLimitedString` _possible._

A string `a` is _lexicographically larger_ than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. If the first `min(a.length, b.length)` characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically larger one.
