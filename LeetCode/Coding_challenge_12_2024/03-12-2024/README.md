# **Adding Spaces to a String**

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a **0-indexed** integer array `spaces` that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each space should be inserted `before` the character at the given index.

- For example, given `s = "EnjoyYourCoffee"` and `spaces = [5, 9]`, we place spaces before `'Y'` and `'C'`, which are at indices `5` and `9` respectively. Thus, we obtain `"Enjoy Your Coffee"`.

Return the _modified_ string **_after_** the spaces have been added.
