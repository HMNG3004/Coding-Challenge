# **Coding Challenges Repository** ðŸš€  

## Overview  
Welcome to the **Coding Challenges Repository**! This repository serves as a centralized hub for all the coding challenges I have solved across various platforms. It's a collection of problem-solving exercises, algorithms, and data structure implementations aimed at improving programming skills and sharpening problem-solving techniques.  

### Platforms Included  
This repository includes challenges from the following platforms:  
- **LeetCode**: Focused on algorithmic problem-solving and coding interviews.  
- **Advent of Code (AOC)**: Festive programming challenges designed for December.  

---

## Language of Choice  
I primarily use **C#** for solving these challenges, taking advantage of its robust libraries, object-oriented features, and strong type system.

## Repository Structure  
The repository is organized to make navigation simple and intuitive. Challenges are grouped by platform and further categorized by month or topic.
