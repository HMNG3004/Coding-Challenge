# **Find the Difference of Two Arrays**

Given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _a list `answer` of size `2` where:_

- `answer[0]` _is a list of all **distinct** integers in `nums1` which are **not** present in `nums2`._
- `answer[1]` _is a list of all **distinct** integers in `nums2` which are **not** present in `nums1`._

**Note** that the integers in the lists may be returned in **any** order.
