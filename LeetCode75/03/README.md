# **Greatest Common Divisor of Strings**

There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the **i<sup>th</sup>** kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

_Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving the **i<sup>th</sup>** kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the **greatest** number of candies among all the kids, or `false` otherwise._

Note that **multiple** kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.
