# **Move Zeroes**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a **subsequence** _of_ `t`, _or_ `false` otherwise.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).
