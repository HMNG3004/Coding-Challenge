## Approach to the Problem

### **Step 1: Input Parsing**

We begin by reading the input data provided in a text file. Each line corresponds to a specific clue about the Historian's whereabouts.

### **Step 2: Logic Implementation**

Using the rules from the challenge:

1. Process each clue sequentially.
2. Apply the logic described in the problem to determine the Historianâ€™s location.
3. Consider edge cases, such as duplicate locations or unexpected input formats.

### **Step 3: Result Calculation**

After processing all clues, output the exact location where the Historian is most likely to be found.
