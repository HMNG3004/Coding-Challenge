# **Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports** ðŸŽ„

## Challenge Overview

While the Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant appears to contain no sign of the Chief Historian, the engineers there run up to you as soon as they see you. Apparently, they still talk about the time Rudolph was saved through molecular synthesis from a single electron.

## Approach to the Problem

### **Step 1: Input Parsing**

We begin by reading the input data provided in a text file. Each line corresponds to a specific clue about the Historian's whereabouts.

### **Step 2: Logic Implementation**

Using the rules from the challenge:

1. Process each clue sequentially.
2. Apply the logic described in the problem to determine the Historianâ€™s location.
3. Consider edge cases, such as duplicate locations or unexpected input formats.

### **Step 3: Result Calculation**

After processing all clues, output the exact location where the Historian is most likely to be found.
